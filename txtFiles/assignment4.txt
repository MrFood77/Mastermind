1.2) Yes it does.

1.4) 
It tells the client for how long the retrieved item will be _fresh_, meaning how old it can get before a new version should be requested.

2.1)
PUT /random781 HTTP/1.1
host:httpbin.org
Content-type:text/plain
Content-length:12
Hello World!

Works when content length is correct.
When content length is smaller than it should be, the rest of the message is cut off. 
eg "Hello World!" becomes "Hello worl" with content size 10 instead of 12.
When content-length is larger than it should be, it is made the same size by adding '/r'.

        1) "Dont make me think"
            None of the selected websites have a clear UI, we need to think about how to play pieces.
            See "/Example1.PNG"
        2) "Minimize noise and clutter"
            There is a lot of noise and clutter on this site.
            Most of the clutter has even been removed by my adblocker.
            See "/Example2.PNG"
        3) "Performace"
            This website uses Flash.
            See "/Example3.PNG"
        
        Game features:
        Positive:
        1) Nr 2 has animations which add to the feel of game.
        2) You can change the code length and other rules of the game.
        3) It has a colorblind-friendly version.
        Negative:
        1) In Nr 1 the buttons are small and hard to press.
        2) None of the games allow you to be game master instead of only game breaker.
        3) None of them have sound.
