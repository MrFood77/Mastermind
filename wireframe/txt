## Codemaster
# Make a code
# Wait for your opponent to guess the code
# You get a point for each guess the opponent makes
# After the code is guessed or the opponent runs out of guesses you switch sides

## Codebreaker
# Guess the code made by the opponent
# You get the amount of correct colors and correct positions
# Guess until you get it right
# When you guess right or runn out of guesses you switch sides
